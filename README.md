#### PartsUnlimted and PartsUnlimited MRP

PartsUnlimited and PartsUnlimited MRP
Some labs in this course will use a sample application to provide a real-world experience. The sample application consists of two parts:

PartsUnlimited (PU): a .NET Core 2.0 application that is used for labs based on Microsoft products.
PartsUnlimted Manufacturing Resource Planning (PUMRP): The application uses entirely open-source software including Linux, Java, Apache, and MongoDB, which creates a web front end, an order service, and an integration service.
Parts Unlimited and PartsUnlimited MRP are fictional applications used purely for training purposes and are based on the description in chapters 31-35 of The Phoenix Project by Gene Kim, Kevin Behr, and George Spafford. (© 2013 IT Revolution Press LLC, Portland, OR.) Resemblance to “Project Unicorn” in the novel is intentional; resemblance to any real company is purely coincidental.

The sample applications can be downloaded from the GitHub pages, and you will be directed at various stages in the lab steps to download and use the relevant sample application.
